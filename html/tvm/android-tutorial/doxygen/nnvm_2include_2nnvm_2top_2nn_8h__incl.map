The layout is composed of upper cases, lower cases and numbers, where upper case indicates a (super&#45;)dimension and the corresponding lower case with factor size indicates the split (sub&#45;)dimension. For example, NCHW16c can describe a 5&#45;D tensor of [batch_size, channel, height, width, channel_block]. Here sub&#45;dimension channel_block=16 is the split of super&#45;dimension C (channel).
