Before that, I had practical experience in machine learning, embedded systems, and web frontend. I had no practical experience in any of these areas, but I was able to release the features I developed with the support of those around me. I understand not only how to write code, but also the entire development cycle, including operations.</p><p>Due to schedule and other constraints, I had to output while learning. Therefore, I gave up on trying to understand everything, and instead read company&#x27;s codebase to understand the internal conventions and write code that looked like it (like machine learning models), and I decided not to learn unnecessary things to achieve my tasks. I have released bugs due to a lack of understanding of platform-specific behavior, but I learned a lot through fixing the bugs and its post motems I probably can continue to get opportunities to develop them, and I will improve my understanding of them in the future.</p><p>Now that I have more technologies that I can use and have confidence that I&#x27;m able to learn new things as well in the future, I will be able to think flexibly about future opportunities to select technologies for my hobbies and work.</p><h1 id="looking-back-on-my-career"><a href="#looking-back-on-my-career" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Looking back on my career</h1><p>I remember hearing a great person say something like, &quot;I have only been about sincerely dealing with things around me. That&#x27;s my career.&quot; at an internal career study session, and I thought it was cool, so I put it into practice in my own way this year.</p><p>I deprioritized my personal technical interests and did what I had to do to solve the problems required for my projects. I have several things that need to be improved in this approach, but I was happy that I was able to contribute to the people around me through my own efforts.</p><h1 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h1><p>I had good opportunities to learn new things in 2022.
